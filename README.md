# Tour-Buddy

**Tour-Buddy** is a Geographic Information System (GIS) application designed for tourists, offering features similar to Google Maps. Developed as part of a team of 3 for my ECE297 course, the application was built using the OpenStreetMap API, GTK, and Glade. Tour-Buddy provides users with heat maps, night mode, and detailed directions for enhanced travel experiences. 

Due to school policy, the code cannot be posted publicly.

## Key Features

- **Heat Maps**: Visualize data trends and popular locations.
- **Night Mode**: Adjusts the interface for better visibility in low light.
- **Detailed Directions**: Get precise navigation instructions from any location to your destination.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed with GTK and Glade for a user-friendly experience.

## Algorithms and Data Management

- **Route-Finding**: Utilized Dijkstra and A* algorithms for efficient pathfinding.
- **Data Structures**: Implemented Tries and sorted maps to manage data effectively.
