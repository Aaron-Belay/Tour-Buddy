# Tour-Buddy

**Tour-Buddy** is a Geographic Information System (GIS) application designed for tourists, offering features similar to Google Maps. It helps users navigate unfamiliar cities while providing valuable insights into popular attractions and local amenities. Developed as part of a team of 3 for my ECE297 course, the application was built using the OpenStreetMap API, GTK, and Glade. With features like heat maps, night mode, and detailed directions, **Tour-Buddy** enhances travel experiences by making navigation intuitive and informative.
